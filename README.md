Sure, let's update the `README.md` file to include the installation of Ollama as a prerequisite:

# Ubuntu Open Interpreter Environment

This project sets up an Ubuntu environment using Docker, allowing you to test and create software on an Ubuntu system with [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter). The Open Interpreter is configured to communicate with a locally compiled version of [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/) running on your host system.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) installed and running on your host system

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/avnigashi/ollama-open-interpreter-ubuntu.git
    cd ollama-open-interpreter-ubuntu
    ```

2. **Create Workspace Directory**
    Ensure you have a `workspace` directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir workspace
    ```

3. **Build and Start the Container**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

## Usage
Once the container is running, you can access it using:

```sh
docker exec -it ubuntu22_container /bin/bash
```

Inside the container, you have access to the Open Interpreter which communicates with your locally compiled Ollama. You can use the `ipr` alias for ease of use:

```sh
ipr
```

The `ipr` command runs the Open Interpreter with the necessary environment variables already configured.

## Directory Structure
```
your_project_directory/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
└── workspace/
```
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker Compose configuration.
- `Dockerfile`: Specifies the Docker image build process.
- `workspace/`: A directory for your project files and development workspace.

This update ensures that users are aware they need to have Ollama installed and running on their host system as a prerequisite before setting up and using the Docker environment.
